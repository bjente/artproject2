# Art-project-2019-2020
In this repository you'll find the data and python programs for my graduation project.
The ultimate goal is to create 'step-by-step plans' for the creation of new artworks.
I want to create these 'step-by-step plans' using data from Tate modern and The Museum of Modern Art New-York.
I am using an apriori algorithm right now. This algorithm looks at combinations that occur often together.
I want to look at other combinatorial algorithms as well.


Instructions pushing files to git repository:

1. git add --all
